                            <strong>MANILA —</strong> In the search for one's own light, there is always the possibility of being blinded by the shine of others. <em>"Bakit nga ba mas maningning ang ilaw nila?"</em> (Why is their light brighter?) The science is simple: stars closer to us appear brighter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hannah Grace Ingua, a BA Speech Communication student, builds her practice on this principle of proximity. She believes that for a message to shine, it must be close enough to touch the audience. 
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="subhead">Buried and Unseen</h4>
                        <p>
                            Her strategy is rooted in the 'dead of night'—the quiet, unglamorous toil hidden from sight. She understands that the greatest seeds are buried and unseen, requiring the silence of the soil to truly take hold. She operates not for the applause of the moment, but for the longevity of the impact, trusting that what is truly hers will always bloom in due time.
                        </p>

                            “May you find the courage to fail—with grace. That such grace reminds you that you are not a mere dust in the wind, but the wind itself striving to blow against the current. That your heart is not made of ice, for it burns so brightly. That when you do burn bright, may you learn not to let the fire consume you.”

                        <p>
                            In a world that demands conformity, Ingua chooses to "flow away from the current to reach the oasis of growth." She was always an open book, but she refuses to be written in a cryptic language that no one dares to decipher.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Her communication style is about making the complex readable, ensuring that unlike the open book in her poetry, people actually care to read, comprehend, and understand every page.

Hannah Grace Ingua is a senior student at <strong>UP Diliman</strong>, but she is also an accumulation of every lesson learned from <strong>La Concordia College</strong> and every bridge she has had to burn to find peace.

                            <p>
                                She often says she is the sum of all things she has once loved—that is true. But she also embraces the parts that are "hindi kamahal-mahal" (not lovable). It is this radical acceptance of the messy, human side of existence that makes her leadership authentic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As the <strong>Student Council President</strong> at Concordia and now <strong>Department Representative</strong> at UP, she leads not with perfection, but with the understanding that "to heal is to let go of what holds you back."
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Ingua operates on a philosophy of reciprocity, though she knows it often feels foreign. She gives her "pebbles"—her work, her advocacy, her voice—not to be chosen, but because, like a penguin with a handful of stones, she simply cannot stop giving them.
